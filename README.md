# hybrid-child
WordPress Theme build by ePAPUA.com based on Rock-solid "hybrid" theme by Justin T.

These themes were developed step by step as child-themes, but I am looking ahead to turn it into "themes', maybe one or more.

What I am adding here are mostly related to menus, sidebars/ widgets, breadcrumbs, and a major hack is on the style. I am utilizing the 
famous YUI CSS Grids. This is basically true because I like the neatness and elegent looking of Yahoo CSS Styles and grids.

I am also using some of YUI Javasscripts, Version 2 or 3.
